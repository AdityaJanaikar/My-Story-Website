<h3>The Prodigy Gunslinger</h3>    
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNevada, 1875. This was an era of gunslingers and horsemen. Extremely skilled and ruthless shooters, paid on kills and captured areas, emerged all across the place in search of money, fame and glory. These were termed cowboys with the term being evolved from horsemen who looked after cattle. The weak populous who mostly couldn’t do the fighting were compared to cattle. Everybody was on the lookout for good fighters to hire or were training themselves, sometimes just for the fear of their and their loved ones’ safety, and the other times for ‘manifesting their destiny’.</p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA young man by the name of Porco who lived in the barren Nevada countryside had plenty of reasons to become a cowboy. His father was a cowboy and a member of one of the most powerful groups of cowboys and people in general consisting of about 20 members called the Gold Sandmen. The respect his dad had in the village made him believe it was his job to be the successor of the feared ‘Shotgun master’. They said he was one of the few people who could wield and were actually given the authority to wield the double barrel shotgun.</p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe gang was backed up by government officials as the States’ government was into the process of expansion onto the west or ‘manifesting destiny’ as they called it. They invaded and expanded to territories beyond their boundaries under the command of the government. Each day was a fight and in a situation like that, one can’t expect to not be hurt or worse, dead. And then the news came to him, his father was killed in battle. Both his shotgun and his horse were nowhere to be found. The gang turned to the son for being the father’s replacement and just like that Porco was now a part of the Gold Sandmen. He was trained by the other members and his skills improved drastically. It was in fact so fast that he earned himself his very own nickname, ‘the prodigy gunslinger’. A horse, a hat and a shotgun, Porco had found himself the glory that he wished for and was also making ends meet.</p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne day, while on a break Porco was walking by. Some members of the crew were whispering:</p>
<p>“Hey how long will we hide things from the brat? He has a right to know at least.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be stupid, do you think anything will go well if we tell him? Besides, only the powerful have rights, we don’t. If we tell him he’d probably meet the same fate as his dad.”</p>
<p>“Maybe that’s true. But why did the boss not even oppose that officer fellow?”</p> 
<p>“Because he knew. Even if you are the shotgun master or whatever, if you oppose the ranks, they’ll dispose you off. Also, they must have wanted that shotgun for themselves. You know the rumors about that thing right.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I heard that it can kill four people with one shot.”</p>
<p>All of this was a huge reveal to Porco. He wanted to know what happened to his dad, if he truly died in battle or something else actually happened.</p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlthough the question he had was clear, it was hard to determine who could answer it and more importantly, whom should it be kept a secret from. Porco knew he couldn’t ask the boss directly about this. So, he decided to sneak around for more information. Then a man called Warner, who was the best horse rider and the crew’s scout, saw Porco sneaking around and decided to confront him. Porco had to reveal his intentions to Warner and thus he said:</p>
<p>“I suppose it's about time we tell you the truth. Your dad opposed the expansionist ruthless policies of the government in a meeting and refused to go to the battle field unless it was a war to protect their own territory. The officials didn’t like this stance aas he was defying the very purpose of hiring him. Since your dad refused to back down, they decided they’ll get rid of the guy. Also take the custody of the double barrel shotgun along with it. You know why only your dad was allowed to wield it right.”</p>
<p>“No”</p>
<p>“Everybody says it's because it could only be wielded by a skilled gunman, but that’s not the entire truth. That gun has the power to make anybody who wields it, the best gunman. Since they didn’t want to hand that sort of a weapon to a random weakling, they had to choose the best and make up that excuse. I’m sure even your dad believed it.”</p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt was a shock to Porco, but it was the kind of story he expected after hearing the other members talk sneakily about such a respected dude and his father. Warner also revealed that some of the members of the gang are very dissatisfied with the way the officials are treating them, and with the boss’s silence. They had plans to assassinate the Police commissioner Maxwell and the boss of the gang, Charles. Warner invited Porco to be a part of the plan, to which he responded:</p>
<p>“ I want to kill that commissioner so badly. I’m in on the plot to kill that bastard. I’ll also get my dad’s shotgun from him. But I don’t want to kill the boss. I won’t get in your way either but I don’t want to be a part of that plan.”</p>
<p>“Very well then. Here’s the basic plan”</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWarner then begins to explain the plan of action to Porco and also conveys his involvement to the other peers. </p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe day grew near, the time to exact his revenge for his dad’s death was finally on the horizon. The teams were to split into two, one of them led by Porco was to enter the police station, find out where the gun was kept, get it back (it wasn’t stealing in their heads) and then assassinate the commissioner. The other team, led by Warner, was to confront the boss and his loyal subordinates and eliminate them.</p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt was finally time, Warner departed with his share of the crew, and Porco departed with his. They entered the police station normally as they were technically government hired agents. Soon the crew met up with a constable there and went with him to his room. Then the fun part began. They threatened him by placing a silenced pistol in his mouth and he had to back down and reveal the location. Porco left some people to keep a check on the man and he left to find the gun. He found it in the exact room the constable told him it would be. Since there was no security as such, he barged into the room. He found one man guarding the entire weaponry. Porco shot him in the head and took the gun for himself. He also distributed some official ammunition to his boys. They wreaked havoc in the police station. The commissioner then came out with some pistols and some other men. It was an exchange battle with lives lost on both sides. In the end, Porco shot the double barrel and the commissioner's head rolled. With his death, the rest of the police surrendered to the cowboys. Porco gave the order to retreat as he didn’t want any unnecessary bloodshed but he captured all of them and took them along. Few hours later, Porco and Warner met up and reported a mission completed. The powerful Gold Sandmen were wiped out of existence, just like that.</p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA few days had passed, by this time the Gold Sandmen were entirely restructured with Warner and Porco at the top. They gave up their accountability to the government and took control of the area. They had a building where they set up a camp for all the captured police officers, which they had to maintain to prevent intel leaks without killing them.</p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne day Porco was just walking through their makeshift prison when one of the prisoners lashed out at him.</p>
<p>“Hey you. You think you did some kind of fulfilling work. You assassinated our boss just like that. The news will spread, the government won’t spare you.”</p>
<p>This annoyed Porco and he replied:</p>
<p>“Yeah, shut up. All of you in the police murdered my dad and unjustly suppressed the wishes of our gang even though we were working for you.”</p>
<p>“So are you on a mission to do what your dad wanted to but couldn’t huh? All of you cowboys only care about controlling land, power and money.”</p>
<p>“What the hell do you mean by that? You guys murdered my dad when he denied to go along with your expansionist policies. You guys are the last ones who should be talking about controlling land.”</p>
<p>“Okay you are making no sense now. Who told you this garbage story? Let me tell you the truth. Your dad was killed by the police because in return for his services he demanded a chunk of land for him to govern and control. The government turned him down but he just wouldn’t listen, so we had to silence him. Your dad was no hero.”</p>
<p>“And on what basis do I believe you murderers?”</p>
<p>“Ask any of the officials or even people outside the station. They’ll tell you about the negotiations and the argument that occurred that day.”</p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAt that moment, a bunch of police carriages arrived outside the prison. He went outside to check what was going on. As soon as he went out, all the personnel pointed guns at him. Warner was standing between those officials as they yelled,</p>
<p>“Put your hands on your head, you are under arrest for conspirating the murder of a senior police commissioner.”</p>
<p>Porco was undeniably shocked at this when Warner said:</p>
<p>“I guess my job is over now. Will you let me go now? You found the killer right.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we’ll let you go.”</p>
<p>Porco was furious:</p>
<p>“Warner what is this about, you sold me out to the police.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know anything man, you shot the commissioner and you caused that havoc at the police station. I am not even in your group.”</p>
<p>“You’re kidding me right. You murdered the boss of Gold Sandmen in our plot for revenge and gaining power right.”</p>
<p>“That is not official business, that was simply a gang’s differences in opinion. Right officer?”</p>
<p>“You cowboy gangs can fight and kill yourselves for all I care. I only have business with the murderer of Maxwell.”</p>
<p>“See. That isn’t a crime. What you did is. Men, take him away please. “</p>
<p>Whispers in the officer’s ear:</p>
<p>“You better get me that gun according to our deal.”</p>
<p>“Yeah I will. I’m a man of my word.”</p>
	
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPorco realized that he was being set up all this time to take the blame for killing the officer, then Warner would get him out of the way and take the gang and the gun for himself. He was about to be handcuffed and taken by the police, when he loaded his shotgun and shot at the approaching officer, also killing the one behind him in the process. He then ducked back into cover and the battle began. He called for backup of his men from inside the prison. Both sides shot at each other. Porco at this point didn’t care what would happen to him later, he desperately wanted to kill the traitor Warner with his own two hands and get out of this mess.</p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the crossfire, Porco somehow managed to get an angle and he jumped on Warner and hit him on the chest with a double barrel bullet. Warner also managed to get a pistol shot on his knee, but the double barrel took its toll on Warner and he died. The fight dragged on and eventually the police overpowered the gang. Porco couldn’t move a lot as he was shot on the knee. At the end, he was captured by the police.</p> 

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA few days later, he was charged for the assassination plot of commissioner Maxwell and some more government officials and the subordinates. Officially speaking, Warner and his subordinates were still government agents. So that was also included in his charge. He was executed in the Nevada central jail. A talented man fell victim to the curse of revenge and manipulation by certain snakes, in the end his carelessness and rash actions lead to his own demise.</p>
